# HighSchoolSimulator
This started as a fun project to get away from doing school but after dumping roughly 10-12 hours into it in 2 days I decided to try to flesh it out and publish it.
## Getting Started
These instructions will guide you through getting the source code downloaded on to your computer so that you can run the game in your browser.
### Prerequisites
This game has been tested in Google Chrome and Internet Explorer. It will work in Internet Explorer, but some CSS properties will not be supported, resulting in blurry images. Firefox has not been tested at this point.
### Installing
*Screenshots will be added at some point to make this even more simple*
1. Go to the releases page on this GitHub repository and download the .zip file.
2. Open your file manager and click on the .zip file.
3. Extract the .zip file.
4. Open index.html in your browser to play!
## Deployment
This will eventually be packaged with Electron to be installed locally like any other app.
